            <h2>What is a Technical Interview?</h2>

            <p>Technical interviewing can be a combination of walking an interviewer through a technical project, answering questions about the applications of various methods, and a discussion of innovations in the company's industry. It can be common for interviewers to ask brain teasers or reasoning problems to test how well you can solve problems. Make sure to highlight your skills as you answer questions, both in terms of technical capabilities and critical thinking.</p>

            <h2>Preparing for an Interview</h2>

             <p>Before any interview it is important to do some research and preparations. Take a moment to look up the company and find out some background information on your interviewers using LinkedIn. Ensure that your resume and portfolio are ready and you can comfortably discuss all of the content in them. Lastly make sure you know where the interview is taking place and find a quiet distraction free location if the interview is virtual.</p>

            <h2>How to Answer Technical Questions</h2>

            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Keep Answers Concise:</strong> Aim to speak for no more than 2-3 minutes or you may loose the interviewer's attention.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Basics in the Field:</strong> You may be asked questions about fundamentals such as when to use certain programming concepts.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Your Past Projects:</strong> Prepare to talk about you team based technical project work and your specific role.</li>
                <li><strong>You Don't Have to Know Eveyting:</strong> It is perfectly ok to not know the exact answer to the question; the interviewer wants to see your thought process when problem solving.</li>
